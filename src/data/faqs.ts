        q: "Is Clear Retro completely free?",
        a: "Yes. We offer a generous free tier that includes unlimited boards and up to 5 participants per session. No credit card is required to get started."
    },
    {
        q: "Do participants need an account?",
        a: "No. We believe in removing friction. You can share a secure link, and teammates can join your board instantly as guests. Only the facilitator needs an account (optional for free tier)."
    },
    {
        q: "How does the AI grouping work?",
        a: "We use Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model. It analyzes the semantic meaning of every card on the board and groups them into themes (e.g., 'Deployment', 'Communication') automatically, saving you 15 minutes per retro."
    },
    {
        q: "Is my data secure?",
        a: "Absolutely. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. AI processing is stateless—your retrospective data is never used to train Google's models."
    },
    {
        q: "Can I export the results?",
        a: "Yes. You can export your board to a formatted PDF report for stakeholders or a CSV/Excel file for data analysis."
    },
    {
        q: "Do you support custom templates?",
        a: "We provide industry-standard templates like Start/Stop/Continue, Mad/Sad/Glad, and 4Ls. You can also create custom columns to fit your team's specific workflow."
